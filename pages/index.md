# Homebrew Arcade Games by BossRighteous

Bringing my own, and hopefully other indie dev's, games to to life via physical hardware in public spaces like arcades.

## Where to Play

The cabinet is currently at [Headless Horseman Arcade](https://headlesshorsemanarcade.com/) in Wheeling, IL (a Chicago suburb). Many thanks to David for hosting me!

## Now Playing

Until my first minigame is ready, enjoy Tecmo's [Monster Farm Jump](https://www.arcade-museum.com/Videogame/monster-farm-jump)

# DIY Retro-gaming Sessions at Headless Horseman Arcade

This summer I'll be hosting some group maker sessions on the following topics
- Make your own Fight-stick (Arcade style USB controller)
- Set up a cheap single board computer with Batocera for TV retrogaming on a budget
- Wiring your own multi-game arcade cabinet with off-the-shelf goods
- Emulators: software, handhelds and FPGAs
- Game engines: No-code, low-code and beyond!

## About the Project (and Me)

I've loved arcades and arcade games since I can remember. I have fond memories of the local mall's arcade as a boy. As a teen I built a MAME cabinet with money from my first job. Today I have an imported Vewlix with a MiSTer and try to frequent local arcades on the weekends.

In my early teens I picked up Klik 'n' Play then Games Factory then Multimedia Fusion. In college I learned Flash and JavaScript made various interactive projects and games. Lately I've picked up Godot and other more modern engines to produce fun demos.

Indie games are terrific and it's never been easier to create and share fun games of any scale. As a middle aged SaaS programmer I've accepted I'll never have the time or patience to release a full fledged game that can compete with the hundreds of other games released every day. That's okay!

It's always been a bucket list goal for me to create a playable cabinet with my own (and others?) games to play freely. This year I decided to make that happen! If you are a like-minded dev and want to see your game played in an arcade drop me a line!
